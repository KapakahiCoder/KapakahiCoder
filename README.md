I'm Garrett and I'm a software engineer. I'm originally from Hawaii🌊 but moved to Japan🗻 about 20 years ago. After a career in accounting🧾 and education🏫, I recently made the transition to the tech industry🖥️. I love learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world🌎 problems. My journey as a developer is just beginning and I can't wait to see where it will take me.
